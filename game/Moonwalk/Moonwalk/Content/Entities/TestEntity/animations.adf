/ Use the & to set the animation type. This should be set before any data is read and there should
/ only be one type per animation data file. (It will default to Horizontal if none is set)
/ The choices are Horizontal and Vertical (respectivly).
&Horizontal

/ Use the @ symbol to set default values. This used so that information doesn't needed to repeated.
/ This can be set multiple times if you desired, but you should always set it if you plan on using
/ default values (or else bad things will happen D:< )

/ The following is the expected format for animations. Replace <Text> with the expected value
/ <Individual Sprite's Width>x<Individual Sprite's Width>,<Origin X>:<Origin Y>,<Amount of Sprites in Animation>,<Amount of Frames Each Sprite Last For>
@32x32,0:0,8,5

/ The following READ lines are information related each animation.
